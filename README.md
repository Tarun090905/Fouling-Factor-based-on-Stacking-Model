# Fouling-Factor-based-on-Stacking-Model
This project uses a stacked ensemble machine learning model to predict the fouling factor in heat exchangers. It combines multiple regression algorithms to improve prediction accuracy, helping to optimise maintenance schedules and enhance energy efficiency in thermal systems.
